# Statistics and map visualization based on city of Tampere open spatial data

Idea is that user can easily compare different areas of the city based on the open data that is available for the city. For example,
user could easily compare if two suburbs have similar amount of sports fields and also see specific locations and types of the fields. The project utilizes / will utilize
city of Tampere open data and some other open data sources.
